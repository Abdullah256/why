    <p>yay you finally graduated!!! a year later than the rest but hey it’s ok, everyone does things at their own pace.</p>
    <p>five years is a lot of time for a lot to happen, the journey must’ve been insane in ways only you fully understand.</p>
    <p>the people who got to witness that up close are incredibly lucky to have been a part of it.</p>

    <div class="easter-egg" id="easterEgg">
      <p>it’s kind of wild that we only met on farewell last year.</p>
      <p>i wasn’t there for your time at lums, but i’m genuinely grateful i got to hover at the peripheries, even if just for a short while.</p>
      <p>it has been great getting to know you in whatever capacity it has been. you’re a very unique person with earnestness and warmth being parts of the tessellated prism that you are — always refracting something unexpectedly kind, present, or joyous.</p>
      <p>i hope the road ahead brings you every kind of success, and more love than you even know how to ask for.</p>
      <p>it’s also a little insane to think we’ll probably never meet again. yet circumstantially you were part of the quiet tapestry i ended up cherishing so much this past year.</p>
      <p>ew but I’ll miss whatever small space that was and it wouldn’t have been the same without you.</p>
      <p>i hope i wasn’t too annoying. it really was great knowing you.</p>
      <p>good luck with everything ahead.</p>
      <p>also you are the kinda person that makes you curious as to what kind of light the world will throw through the prism that is them, and what strange, beautiful, enchanting patterns it’ll leave behind.</p>
      <p>crazy that you’re a lawyer now as well amongst the multitude of things you already were and will be in the future.</p>
      <p>yet how strange it is to be anything at all.</p>
      <p>they should invent a new kinda friend that never leaves.</p>
      <p>see you i guess, have a great life!!</p>
